<div align="center"><img src="./SwissKnife.png"></div>

A multi-purpose *Groovy* library containing view injection and threading for Android using annotations. It's based on both [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/) and [AndroidAnnotations](https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations).

With **SwissKnife** you can:

* Inject views dynamically on *any Object* as long a you have a View to find them. No more ``findViewById`` and **you don't have to extend any classes**.
* Add callback methods to several actions using ``@OnClick``, ``@OnItemClick``, etc.
* Execute methods in the UI Thread or a background one using ``@OnUIThread`` and ``@OnBackground``.
* Make your variables persistent across state changes **without messing with** `onSaveInstanceState`.
* Make anything Parcelable with the `@Parcelable` annotation - which can be used with `@SaveInstance` to automatize data persistance. **NO MORE PARCELABLES! YAY!**
* Inject resources into your classes with `@Res` annotations (`@StringRes`, `@AnontationRes`, etc.).
* Read intent extras automatically with `@Extra` annotation.

You can see an example here:

```groovy
class MyActivity extends Activity {

  @StringRes(R.string.important_message)
  String reallyImportantMessage

  @Extra("api_key")
  String apiKey

  @SaveInstance
  public String myString;

  @OnClick(R.id.button)
  public void onButtonClicked(Button button) {
    Toast.makeText(this, "Button clicked", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  }

  @OnBackground
  public void doSomeProcessing(URL url) {
    // Contents will be executed on background
    ...
  }

  @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        // This must be called for injection of views and callbacks to take place
        SwissKnife.inject(this);

        // This must be called for saved state restoring
        SwissKnife.restoreState(this, savedInstanceState);

        // This mus be called for automatic parsing of intent extras
        SwissKnife.loadExtras(this)
    }
}
```

## Collaborators

I'd really want to thank:

* [Mario García](https://github.com/mariogarcia) for his help on the new GH-Pages based documentation.
* [Dexafree](https://github.com/dexafree) for adding `@SaveInstance` annotation and helping with the testing.
* [Eugene Kamenev](https://github.com/eugene-kamenev) for adding DSL functionality to *[android-dsl](https://github.com/Arasthel/SwissKnife/tree/android-dsl)* branch.
* [Karol](https://github.com/OrdonTeam) for injection on any object.
* [Andrew Reitz](https://github.com/pieces029) for keeping the build files up to date.
* [Pavel](https://github.com/MrBIMC) for his resource injection AST transforms.

You all make SwissKnife the great tool it is!

## Documentation

If you want to learn more, you can check [Swissknife's docs page](http://arasthel.github.io/SwissKnife).

It contains info about the install instructions, all the annotations, DSLs, configurations, etc.

You can find all the releases and their changes here: [RELEASES](https://github.com/Arasthel/SwissKnife/releases)

## Using it

To use SwissKnife **you must use Groovy on your Android project** as the code generation is done using AST processing, which is a Groovy feature. You can learn how to do that using [this plugin](https://github.com/melix/groovy-android-gradle-plugin) on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/Arasthel/SwissKnife/wiki/How-to-use-Groovy).

Once your project App Module is configured to use Groovy you can add this library as a dependency cloning it with ``git clone`` or as a maven library on the **build.gradle** of your App Module:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "com.arasthel:swissknife:1.4.0"
    ...
}
```

If you want *SwissKnife* to update automatically, you could just type:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "com.arasthel:swissknife:+"
    ...
}
```

But make sure you remember to clear Gradle's cache to get the latest version.

Also, [there is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://github.com/Arasthel/SwissKnife/wiki/SwissKnife-IDEA-Plugin) *compatible with Android Studio* that lets you auto-generate the annotations and compatible method declarations.
